WT_NEW Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `WT_NEW` cache builds on the original write–through (WT) data cache
architecture.  A portion of the cache sets is marked as *dual addressable*.
These sets can be accessed by either of two controllers.

* Controller A behaves exactly like the standard WT cache controller and
  addresses all sets of the cache.
* Controller B only sees the dual addressable sets.  These sets are organised
  in a fully‑associative fashion from the perspective of controller B.

Switching between the controllers is bound to the processor privilege level.
When the privilege level changes the dual‑addressable sets are flushed while
all other sets remain untouched.  This allows supervisor or user mode software
to use the private portion of the cache without disturbing the contents used by
machine mode.

The number of dual‑addressable sets is parameterised through
`NUM_DUAL_SETS` and can be set to 2, 4, 8 or 16.
